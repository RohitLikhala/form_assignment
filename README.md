Login/Signup form to order

I have created a login form in the index.html using simple credential of 8-char and 6-char for username and password respectively.

After a successful login it will redirect to a new page called Home.html where you will see A B C D 4 radio button options of whom you will have to choose only one.
After selecting 1 of the 4, when you will click on order button a message will be flashed with the "You Ordered + option you have selected"
(for example, You Ordered: A) in a dialog box.

If no option selected and you still clicked on order button it will flash "order something".

Now what you have to do further is
1. make a signup form using the login form 
2. validate it using the same js used for login
3. and if you wanna use images instead of radio buttons. please do that tooo......haha
